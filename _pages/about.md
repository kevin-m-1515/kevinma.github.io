I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert](http://www.kosagl.com/) in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) affiliated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](http://bid.berkeley.edu/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. Previously, I did my undergraduate research project on modelling individual risk for [COVID-19](https://github.com/kevin-m-1515/COVID-Individual-Risk-Calculator), which was graciously advised by [Dr. Michael Lachmann](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/michael-lachmann) and [Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/mathstat/our-people/faculty/jenfns).

My current research interest lies on the intersection between human-AI interaction, design methodology, and machine learning. I am currently exploring how large langauge models can be used to enhance human creativity, particularly in supporting designers during the early stage of the design process. In addition to my main research focus, I am also exploring the function and objectives of recommender systems. Specifically, I seek to understand what we are optimizing, whether optimization is necessary, and the rationale behind optimizing certain parameters in these systems. These two areas of research interest are currently a part of my broader interest in creating AI systems that are more centered around human needs and usability.

Finally, in addition to my research, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we should apply machine learning, with a focus on what exactly can we predict and infer using machine learning.

Outside of research and work, I am an avid dancer. Currently, I am working on becoming a master of salsa, blues, and ballroom.
