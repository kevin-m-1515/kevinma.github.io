I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert](http://www.kosagl.com/) in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) affiliated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](http://bid.berkeley.edu/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. Previously, I did my undergraduate research project on modelling individual risk for [COVID-19](https://github.com/kevin-m-1515/COVID-Individual-Risk-Calculator), which was graciously advised by [Dr. Michael Lachmann](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/michael-lachmann) and [Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/mathstat/our-people/faculty/jenfns).

My current research interest lies on the intersection between human-AI interaction, design methodology, and machine learning. I am currently exploring how large langauge models can be used to enhance human creativity, particularly in supporting designers during the early stage of the design process. More broadly speaking, I am interested in creating AI systems that are more centered around human needs and usability.

Outside of research and work, I am an avid dancer. Currently, I do a lot of salsa, fusion, and ballroom dancing.
