I also took ME223 Polymers Engineering, taught by the lovely Dr. Pruitt. While it is totally unrelated to my research, this class was a nice reminder as to just how unavoidable plastics are in modern society. *Key takeaway*: if anyone tells you that using lots of plastic is fine and it just needs to be recycled, they are most likely lying to you. The only way to make the Earth cleaner from plastic is to use less plastic.
