Me and a team consisting of 2 undergraduate students and 2 graduate students at Berkeley were given the design task to create remote learning for the future. 

Problem Space:
Remote education has been the most important topic over the last few months, with the global pandemic. While the use of conference calls for remote classes allow teachers-students to continue communication, there seems to be gaps between the traditional ways of being in classrooms with classmates. This project will explore the pros and cons of remote classes and will ideate solutions that may address the pain-points that the current remote classroom is suffering from.

There are four phases of design that this course undergoes:
1. Identify
2. Understand
3. Conceptualize
4. Realize

We first focused on identifying the product opportunity gap (POG) we wanted to focus on. 
We did this by doing user research in the form of identifying social, economic, and technological (SET) factors, creating a stakeholder map, and doing POG generations.

I first identified SET factors using the internet and articles online to support the generation of SET factors.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/hcd/img1.png" title="SET Factors" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The image above shows the list of SET factors we identified collectively.
</div>

I then assisted in the creation of a "Powers of 10" stakeholder diagram. We identified that the initial core stakeholders will be students, teachers, and parents of students from K-12 and college level.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The image above shows the stakeholder map we identified and constructed collectively.
</div>

We also each individually generated 10 POGs. We identified our POGs by voting on which POG we liked the most from the list of POGs we generated. 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/hcd/img3.png" title="List of POGs" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/hcd/img4.png" title="List of POGs" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Each person generated 10 POGs, and the POGs on the green sticky notes are the individual POGs I generated. We did voting by attaching stickers to the POGs we liked, and the POGs that had my votes were the ones with a K attached to it. 
</div>
We noticed commonalities between each of the POGs, so we decided to group the POGs we liked into one generic POG that covered all the specific features we liked from the generated POGs.

The final POG we generated from phase 1 was:
*How might we bridge the gap in educational presence and communication between those who attend remotely and in-person in a hybrid classroom to augment the learning environment?*

Reflecting back on Phase 1, I should have encouraged the team to choose a more specific POG. The lack of a specific POG from Phase 1 caused big issues later on when we did our user research in Phase 2. We lacked a cleared POG, so our user research in Phase 2 was not focused until much later into Phase 2. 

The second design phase is to understand the user.

In this phase, I did a large amount of qualitaitive interviews to formulate our empathy mapping, persona generation, and user journey mapping to understand their pain points and frustrations. I first interviewed two students from an engineering and chemistry background, Emily and Justin, and I asked them broad questions, such as: "what difficulties do you encounter when learning in hybrid classrooms?" and "since going back in person, how often do you use these in person learning tools?". In both cases, Justin and Emily brought up how they were frustrated with the lack of physical lab experiences that hindered crucial experimental skills necessary for their future career. As a result of these responses, I suggested shifting our POG focus to student experiences in a lab setting rather than a generic "hybrid learning" environment.

    </div>

</div>

With the shift to our POG being more focused on labs, me and Jasmine went to Alameda Community Learning Center to interview teachers about their experience with virtual learning to examine what the pain points and difficulties were with virtual learning. We quickly gathered that some of the primary pain points for high school teachers is that they had a high level of difficulty keeping the students engaged and involved. They also felt the low level of interactions between students due to virtual learning hindered the development of the teenagers during that time.

I also interviewd undergraduates regarding their experience with remote learning from a variety of other universities including University of Oxford, Harvey Mudd College, and UC Berkeley. Some key insights I got specifically regarding virtual labs are:

- Computational work to replace experimental work does not work very well
- Lab sessions were not engaging because they were not designed with the intention of being discussion based
- It did not feel like an actual lab
- However, they did appreciate the fact that since the focus was now more on analyzing data and computational studies, they got much better at those skills
- One student also noted that they did not believe in the idea of virtual reality as a substitute for real labs because a big component of experimental labs, at least in the Chemistry setting, is that there is a component of danger and alertness that is critical to the development of being a chemist

I also interviewed graduate student instructors from UC Berkeley, specifically in the field of Biology. Some key insights I got specifically regarding virtual labs are:

- Student-teacher ratio is very high, and it makes it difficult to teach labs effectively
- It is important that students attend labs in person because in person labs serve as an opportunity for students to enhance their motor skills by using experimental tools and examining experimental samples

These interviews cumulated in us focusing our POG to life science lab. I then started assisting in the creation of journey maps and personas to further deepen the understanding of our users.

<div class="caption">

</div>

The stickers I placed were the red stickers. These stickers represented "thoughts", "says", "actions", and "feelings" for the persona of Brand New Bill and Apathetic Amanda.

Brand New Bill is a new instructor that is required to teach students in a life science lab. Some statements I made for him:
- Brand New Bill is feeling inadequate and not sure if he is capable enough to teach the students
- Brand New Bill is always asking if anyone has any questions
- Brand New Bill tries tirelessly to attend to every students needs and does not understand how to set boundaries yet
- Brand New Bill is unsure how to approach this online teaching setting

Apathetic Amanda is an experienced instructor but is also a bit jaded from teaching life science lab. Some statements I made for her:
- Apathetic Amanda hopes nobody asks any more questions
- Apathetic Amanda feels jaded with the prospect of online teaching
- Apathetic Amanda gives insufficient feedback and does not help students

We also cleaned up some ideas and organized our insights during this meeting.

Afterwards, we created two more personas: Enthusiastic Emily, a very enthusiastic and engaged student, and Online Oliver, a student who just started his online learning experience. 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/hcd/img9.png" title="Enthusiastic Emily" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

For Enthusiastic Emily, these are some of the key statements I added for her:
- Actions: Goes to class in person to connect with other students
- Feels: Pressured to do good work

For Online Oliver, these are some of the key statements I added for him:
- Says: "I am so behind on all the class materials right now!!"
- Feels: Jaded and tired of online learning
- Thoughts: "I could multi task while the lecture is going on..."

I also contributed a great deal to the creation of the journey map of both students and educators.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/hcd/img11.png" title="Journey Map of Educators" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Journey Map of Students
</div>

Some key insights I got from these journey maps are:
- Students can have a difficult time focusing if there is a lack of engagement and interaction
- Solutions to mediate this is to make experiments more engaging through tactile, auditory, and visual learning

- Educators can easily feel overwhelmed if there are too many students to teach at once
- Solutions to mediate this is to have better streamline communication between students and educators

Overall, this cumulated in the creation of 5 key product requirements:
- *Adventure*: Product must be flexible enough to allow instructors to create new experimental settings/parameters where students can explore further than what is required
- *Tactile*: Students should be able to "feel" the objects they are touching or interacting with
- *Sense of Place*: Product should allow students to feel as though they are carrying important experiments/observations like a real scientist would
- *Communication*: Product should allow for an easy and open communication pipeline between students and teachers
- *Interactive*: Product must allo students to engage directly with the material within the lab.

The third design phase is to conceptualize the user research.

I individually generated 10 concepts using a combination of forced analogy, design heuristics, and design exploration using Google Patents.

Below are a compiled version of all the 10 different individual designs I generated using a combination of all the methods above.

*Reflections:*

While the artwork was not great, this activity helped me a great deal. Some reflections on this activity was that it was harder than I expected to generate 10 concepts. I had to dig deep into some inspirations from Google patents and functional/visual analogies to generate new concepts. Some of the concepts also became repetitive with slight modifications to them because I frequently ran into mental roadblocks while doing this activity. I tried spreading these concept generations over a couple of days to overcome some of the mental roadblocks, but, by my 8th or 9th design, I was struggling very hard to generate some concepts. Additionally, one of my research work is how can we create better tools to enhance and stimulate the designer's creativity and ability to think outside the box. Doing this activity helped me empathize and understand the challenges designers need to overcome, and it also exposed me to the current design methodologies and tools we can use to overcome these challenges.

I also did 5-3-5 idea generation to improve on each other's idea. These can be seen in the sequence below.

*Reflections:*

This activity exposed me to a lot of different perspectives because I think some people (including me) get stuck on some specific ideas that can be integrated with other people's ideas, and that really helps push the innovativeness of the product design. However, me and the rest of the group became increasingly fatigued and got lazy with concept generation near the end of the 5-3-5 process. I think a better way of doing the 5-3-5 in future design settings would be to do the 5-3-5 concept generation but with breaks in between because if there is too much time constraint, I noticed me and the team just start getting lazy with the concept building.

I also helped in narrowing down the ideas we had from 70 concepts to just 2 concepts. We narrowed down the initial 70 concepts to 4 concepts through the use of dot voting, redundancy reduction, and clustering. These can be seen in our spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G4gaGtEIh5MEooGW6uCaeGdqvF8K28fP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107916177744761914338&rtpof=true&sd=true)

To narrow down the idea from 4 concepts to 2 final concepts, we got feedback from the instructor and other classmates, and we also narrowed down the idea from 2 final concepts to 1 final concept through the use of low fidelity prototyping and storyboarding.

Our final 2 concepts were:

1. BioBox: Sandbox interaction method for life science labs where students can put in virtual animals/plants/bugs into an environment and observe changes over time.
2. Augmented Reality Device: AR glasses headset device where the student can interact with the physical product via projections from AR glasses.

Due to the discomfort of wearing an augmented reality glass headset device, I proposed that we move towards the BioBox because it is more comfortable, more engaging, and more interactive.

Therefore, we moved onto the final design phase: realizing the concept.

We opted to create a video to represent our concept. This one took a long time, and I was the primary actor for the video. 

Check out the video here:

If the video does not display, here's the direct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Vu82-GtJo

I also conducted a small mini user research with a few college students to get some ideas of what they liked and disliked about our project.
Some insights I got is that:
1. They found the concept of how we used the augmented reality was much more exciting than the actual educational product itself.
2. They felt like there could be more instructor-student feedback in the product.
3. They think the concept of going outside and interacting with the world in a similar manner as our product is a unique and immersive concept that has many potential applications beyond just education.

*Overall reflection on this whole project*

I think this class was a very cool experience, and it exposed me to the whole entire design process. In more traditional engineering classes, we tend to ignore the user research aspect of product design, and we would usually jump straight into the prototyping phase after doing some small-scale preliminary research on the internet. I think spending a lot of time interviewing people, collecting user research, and synthesizing those user research was a great experience because it was different yet also a critical component of product design. Additionally, as to how this pertains to my research, I think the heavy emphasis on user research also exposed me to various methods of human research studies, which is a technical skill I am much weaker at and have been wanting to work on. In that regard, I think it benefited me greatly.
