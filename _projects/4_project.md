This was for my CS281A final project. 
Abstract: Migraine is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the first among young adults. Despite the impacts of migraine attacks, we still lack a fundamental understanding of their causes. Triggers of migraines vary from person to person and can be difficult to identify. However, a better understanding of a person's personal triggers may help them to navigate their conditions. Unfortunately, the process of identifying migraine triggers can be ad-hoc and frustratingly uninformative. In this work we (i) introduce simple models of the dynamics of migraines and (ii) begin to explore how triggers can be identified under these models. We also present a preliminary investigation of closed-loop control with the goal of reducing paine from migraines. Although simplified and exploratory, these represent our initial attempts to bring analytical tools developed in system ID, control, and experimental design to the individualized treatment of migraines.

Oh, and the answer to the description question: maybe? To be quite frank, I think the challenges in controlling migraines is more of a systems problem where the interface between how a patient self-diagnoses themselves is still unclear and likely understudied.
