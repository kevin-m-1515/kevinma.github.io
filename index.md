## About Me

I am a Design PhD student in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, which is advised by Prof. Kosa Goucher-Lambert and is closely associated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](https://bid.berkeley.edu/). I completed my BS in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and during that time, I conducted research in COVID-19 risk modelling under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Lachmann](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/michael-lachmann) and [Prof. Jennifer Johnson-Leung](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/mathstat/our-people/faculty/jenfns).

I have worked with [Prof. Can Liu](https://sweb.cityu.edu.hk/canliu/index.html) from the City University of Hong Kong. The goal of our collaboration was to study how GenAI could support designers through the creative process. 

I have also had close collaborations with [Daniele Grandi](https://www.danielegrandi.com/) from AutoDesk Research and [Prof. Chris McComb](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mccomb-christopher.html) from Carnegie Mellon University. In our work, we aimed to understand how capable LLMs are in generating diverse design solutions and compared the diversity of the LLM generated solutions with human crowdsourced design solutions. 

Currently, as of Spring 2024, I am a research intern at the (NASA Langley Research Center)[https://www.nasa.gov/langley/] under the supervision of (Dr. Eric Brubaker)[https://www.ericbrubaker.com/]. Currently, under NASA, we are studying the dynamic of human-AI collaboration through various qualitiative research methods, such as ethnographic observations, interviews, and grounded theory. The goal of our work is to contribute new theoretical insights into human-AI collaboration in the context of design. 

Starting in Summer 2024, I will begin my research internship at HP Inc. under the supervision of [Dr. Jaewoo Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaewoo-chung). 

In addition to my research work, I enjoy advising undergraduate or masters students who are interested in doing human-AI interaction research. My goal is to support future generations of researchers that are interested in pursuing graduate education. Please contact [me](kevinma1515@berkeley.edu) if you are interested.
