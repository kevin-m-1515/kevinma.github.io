## About Me

I am a Design PhD student in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, which is advised by Prof. Kosa Goucher-Lambert and is closely associated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](https://bid.berkeley.edu/). I completed my BS in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and during that time, I conducted research in COVID-19 risk modelling under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Lachmann](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/michael-lachmann) and [Prof. Jennifer Johnson-Leung](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/mathstat/our-people/faculty/jenfns).

During my PhD, I have worked with [Prof. Can Liu](https://sweb.cityu.edu.hk/canliu/index.html) from the City University of Hong Kong to study how generative AI can support designers through the creative process. I have also had close collaborations with [Daniele Grandi](https://www.danielegrandi.com/) from AutoDesk Research and [Prof. Chris McComb](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mccomb-christopher.html) from Carnegie Mellon University studying LLMs capabilities in generating design solutions.

Currently, as of Spring 2024, I am a research intern at the [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley/) under the supervision of [Dr. Eric Brubaker](https://www.ericbrubaker.com/). Under NASA, we are studying the dynamic of human-AI collaboration through various qualitiative research methods, such as ethnographic observations, interviews, and grounded theory. The goal of our work is to contribute new theoretical insights into human-AI collaboration in the context of design. Starting in Summer 2024, I will begin my research internship at HP Inc. under the supervision of [Dr. Jaewoo Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaewoo-chung). 

In addition to my research work, I enjoy advising undergraduate or masters students who are interested in doing human-AI interaction research. My goal is to support future generations of researchers that are interested in pursuing graduate education. If you are a UC Berkeley student and are interested, please feel free to reach out. Outside of research, I am a dancer and a weightlifter.
